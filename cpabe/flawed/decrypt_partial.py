    AC/server side logic.

    For policy P, user SK has QID[a] = g^{w[a]} for each a in their S.

    If user has all attributes in P:

        G = ∏_{a in P} QID[a] = g^{Σ w[a]} = g^{S_w}
        C_dec = e(G, C_hat) = e(g^{S_w}, g^s) = e(g,g)^{S_w·s}

    This matches the exponent in Ce:

        Ce = KEY * e(g,g)^{S_w·s}

    so the user can compute KEY = Ce / C_dec.

    FLAW:
      If user A and B each hold a subset of P, they can pool
      their QID[a] to reconstruct the same G and pass this step
      as if they were a single user.
