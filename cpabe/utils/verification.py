    Verify the traceability equation:

        PSK_i · P  ==  QID_i + h2(ID_i, QID_i) · Tpub_AA

    This ensures:
      - PSK_i is correctly formed for this ID_i and QID_i
      - QID_i and PSK_i are consistent for the given ID_i
      - The token is bound to the system's α (via Tpub_AA)
      - QID_i is not replaced or reused from another user

    IMPORTANT:
      This does NOT fix the collusion flaw, which stems from the
      per-attribute QID[a] not being bound to ID_i at all.

      Returns True if token is valid; False otherwise.
